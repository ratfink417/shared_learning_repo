# Quick Start Guide to Working with Obsidian
 There is no real right way or wrong way to use Obsidian. The purpose of this document is to identify the tools Obsidian offers another document [The Rules of the Repo](The%20Rules%20of%20the%20Repo.md) will explain the specific mechanics of how to write notes for **this repository.**

## Disclaimer About Obsidian
So Obsidian is an obviously great tool. Best example I've heard is its like VSCode for notetaking. That's a pretty accurate statement because just like VSCode you can:
- Customize your layouts, commands, aesthetics, etc. just by modifying some JSON Files stored in the `.obsidian` folder of your vault. 
- There is an entire community of plugins that is constantly expanding and reshaping the ways you can use Obsidian. 
- Everything from a setting, document, notation, link, etc is stored in a text file making it extremely portable for use with Git.
- There are tons of keyboard shortcuts that can also be customized as well as a command pallet that can be accessed from anywhere using the same Ctrl+Shift+P _(Hmmmm where do you think they stole that from?)_ command or.. <sub>_CMD+SHIFT+P for all you Mac whores out there._</sub><div style="text-align: right">*(Don't get offended!....<sub> I am one of you!!!!....SHHHHH!!!!)*</sub>

Now its not all peaches and cream because just like with VSCode....  ![alt image >](dwight-screaming.gif) ***You can get easily and .... COMPLETELY OVERRUN BY THE AMOUNT OF CUSTOMIZATIONS, MODIFICIATIONS AND FINGER POKING TILL YOU HAVE CREATED A GIANT SWIRLING MESS OF SHIT THAT MAKES YOU QUESTION YOUR SANITY AND LONG FOR A PENCIL AND PAPER BUT YOUR SCARED YOU MIGHT GET A PAPER CUT OR STAB YOURSELF WITH PENCIL AND THEN HAVE TO COMMITED TO THE FUCKING LOONEY BIN!!!***<br>
Now that the intro is out of the way we can focus on how to prevent said nightmare from occurring.

# The Zettelkasten method 
Obsidian is a great tool for applying the Zettelkasten method of note taking.  This repository differs a little and is highlighted [here](The%20Rules%20of%20the%20Repo.md)

Links are the bread and butter of how Obsidian leverages note taking to make our ability to store and recall information work in much the same ways as our brains do #WHERE-I-LEFT-OFF

# Repository Folder Structure
The basics for putting notes into folder's is to keep them relatively organized just like any other file system.
