# Modules
To make code in python easy to reuse and organize, there needs to be a way for you to compartmentalize related variables and functions that can be imported into your work as you do things from your script or in the interpreter.

The word for the thing that make this possible is _Modules_ and they are written just like any other script in python except they won't have a declaration of _\_\_main\_\__. In stead you will just write all of the code you would like to reuse across projects and import them in scripts that need to use them
