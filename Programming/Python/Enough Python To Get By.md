# About This Note Series
This was written assuming some knowledge about python and OO stuff in general. So expect a little bit of the benefits of OO that I find inspiring/novel or at least that I feel like I understand but mostly just how they are implemented in Python3 and how to use them in your own stuff.

**What This Note is Not**
- An introduction to python
- About what objects are and why projects use them at the most superficial level... ideally all the bangers none of the mash.

**What To Expect In This Note**
- Stuff you forgot last time you had to do something moderately complicated in python
- Actually a little bit of OO concepts that you might not remember
- The examples about how to write functions, classes decorators and other shit that you were hoping to find on stack overflow but that I found somewhere on SO, books and python3's documentation pages and some youtube videos none of which I will cite unless I found them so useful that I really think you should watch/read the whole thing.
